        We present new equations of state (EOS) for hydrogen and helium,
     intended for applications to low-mass stars (M < 1 Msun), brown
     dwarfs, and giant planets.  They cover the range 2.10 < log T(K) <
     7.06 and 4 < log P (dyn/cm2) < 19 and include new physical treatments
     of partial dissociation and ionization caused by both pressure and
     temperature effects.  The hydrogen EOS is based on a careful study of
     nonideal interactions.  In the case of helium, the principal features
     of the EOS physics are retained in a simplified model.  The
     calculation is based on the free energy minimization method, and a
     detailed account of the physical model has been published elsewhere.
     Mixtures of hydrogen and helium are obtained with the additive volume
     rule and an additional ideal entropy-of-mixing term.  In this paper,
     we present extensive tabular results for both the H and He EOS,
     together with a critical analysis.  Part of this analysis is based on
     a comparison with other EOS commonly used in astrophysics.  Both EOS
     everywhere satisfy the requirements of thermal and mechanical
     stability and are thermodynamically consistent over most of the phase
     diagram.  A complete set of tables is available in the AAS CD-ROM
     Series, Vol. 5, and by anonymous FTP.

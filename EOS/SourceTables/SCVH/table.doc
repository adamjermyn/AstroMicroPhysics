Abstract:
     We present new equations of state (EOS) for hydrogen and helium,
  intended for applications to low-mass stars (M < 1 Msun), brown
  dwarfs, and giant planets.  They cover the range 2.10 < log T(K) <
  7.06 and 4 < log P (dyn/cm2) < 19 and include new physical treatments
  of partial dissociation and ionization caused by both pressure and
  temperature effects.  The hydrogen EOS is based on a careful study of
  nonideal interactions.  In the case of helium, the principal features
  of the EOS physics are retained in a simplified model.  The
  calculation is based on the free energy minimization method, and a
  detailed account of the physical model has been published elsewhere.
  Mixtures of hydrogen and helium are obtained with the additive volume
  rule and an additional ideal entropy-of-mixing term.  In this paper,
  we present extensive tabular results for both the H and He EOS,
  together with a critical analysis.  Part of this analysis is based on
  a comparison with other EOS commonly used in astrophysics.  Both EOS
  everywhere satisfy the requirements of thermal and mechanical
  stability and are thermodynamically consistent over most of the phase
  diagram.  A complete set of tables is available in the AAS CD-ROM
  Series, Vol. 5, and by anonymous FTP.
